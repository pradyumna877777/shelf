1. Introduction

This document outlines the approach for developing a solution to manage user profile images, focusing on uploading, deleting, and fetching images using Amazon S3 and a Spring Boot framework.
The goal is to provide a seamless and secure method for users to interact with their profile images.

2. Solution Approach

The solution involves integrating Amazon S3 for storage, utilizing Spring Boot for building the backend application, and exposing endpoints for uploading, deleting, and fetching user profile images. The approach involves the following steps:

Set up an AWS S3 bucket to store user profile images securely.
Create a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies for AWS SDK and web APIs.
Implement endpoints for uploading, deleting, and fetching user profile images.
Use Amazon S3's presigned URLs to manage secure access to the images.
3. Implementation Steps

Setting Up AWS S3:

Sign up for an AWS account and set up an S3 bucket.
Obtain AWS access credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for programmatic access.
Configure the S3 bucket permissions to ensure secure access.
Creating a Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE to create a Spring Boot project.
Add necessary dependencies:
Spring Web
AWS SDK (AmazonS3Client)
Spring Data JPA (optional, for database storage)
Implementing Upload, Delete, and Fetch:

Create a UserProfile entity to manage user profiles (optional, if using a database).
Implement a service to handle image upload, delete, and fetch operations using Amazon S3.
Implement controller endpoints for each operation, utilizing the service methods.
Use presigned URLs for secure image access and to prevent unauthorized access.
4. Assumptions

The solution assumes that users have valid AWS credentials for access.
5. Alternate Solutions

Instead of using Amazon S3, a local file system or a third-party image storage service could be used.
Different storage strategies, such as storing images in a database, could be considered.
6. Limitations

Limited coverage of user authentication and authorization.
Dependency on AWS services, which might require ongoing cost management.

7. Conclusion

The solution presented offers a comprehensive approach to managing user profile images, leveraging Amazon S3 for storage and Spring Boot for building a RESTful API. Developers can implement the solution, taking into consideration the outlined steps, reasoning, assumptions, and possible alternatives to meet their specific requirements for managing user profile images.
